# Cloning the Latest Release <a name="cloning"></a>

Assuming the output directory should be `monoRTM`:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:AER-RC/monoRTM.git
```

`--recursive` is important, because this repository is linked with our [common FORTRAN modules repository](https://github.com/AER-RC/aer_rt_utils) that are required in the model builds. If this keyword is forgotten, one can do:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

in the `monoRTM` directory.

Currently, the latest release is monoRTM v5.5, and it is recommended that this be the version that users clone and checkout (rather than the `master` branch). To do this, one needs to simply checkout the `v5.5` tag:

```
git checkout tags/v5.5
```

No releases before v5.5 are available via GitHub, but they can be requested by emailing <aer_monortm@aer.com>. For information on previous releases, please visit the [What's New Wiki page](https://github.com/AER-RC/monoRTM/wiki/What's-New).

Instead of cloning, users can also download a monoRTM [tarball](https://github.com/AER-RC/monoRTM/releases/tag/v5.5) and unpack it:

```
tar xvf monortm_v5.5.tar.gz
```

# Directory Structure <a name="structure"></a>

The `MONORTM` directory contains several sub-directories described briefly below:

# Running monoRTM <a name="run"></a>

To generate example output:

```
cd run
run_monortm_examples
```
Note that you may have to modify the executable name in `run_monortm_examples` to match the name of the executable that you have created.

Example inputs and outputs can be found in the [example tarball](https://github.com/AER-RC/monoRTM/files/6804136/monortm_examples.tar.gz).
```

```

# Tailoring monoRTM to Specific Needs

MONORTM is a driver program that calls the core module called the Monochromatic Optical Depth Model (MODM).  The inputs to MODM could be modified inside `monortm.f90` directly or through the input file `MONORTM.IN` (same type of format as LBLRTM's `TAPE5`), see instructions for more details.  MonoRTM is a forward model. MonoRTM is designed to be very flexible. We can either use it as a black box and control everything from the `MONORTM.IN` input file, or one can modify the code itself and recompile it. In the latter, it is structured in such a way that the changes should always be done in `monortm.f90` (the driver program). The other auxillary files (`monortm_sub.f90`, `modm.f90`, `lblatm.f90`, `lblrtm_sub.f`, `tips_2003.f` and `isotope.dat`) should normally not be touched, except in rare situations. In case there is an update in the continuum calculations a new `contnm.f90` module will be generated and sent to the users (or made available
on the WEB/ftp site).

The core of MonoRTM is the computation of the optical depths. It is designed as a subroutine for flexibility and could be easily plugged in a different radiative transfer model if needed.
