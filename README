This is MONORTM directory. It contains several sub-directories described
briefly below:

CVS -> for version control. Do not edit.

bin -> contains the MonoRTM executable. Will be generated automatically.

in  -> contains the input files 
       . spectral_lines.dat : contains the lines informations, depends on the the spectrum.
       . LBLRTM.IN          : input compatible with lblrtm (ex-TAPE5). INP=1
       . MONORTM_PROF.IN    : profile information (temp, WV, etc) in case INP=3 in monortm.f

out -> output from MonoRTM is put in this directory: MONORTM.OUT. 
       IDL code to read this file and to make plots is available in idl sub-directory.


src -> contains all source files needed by MonoRTM as well as the makefile.

doc -> detailed documentation about MonoRTM. 

idl -> visualization tool



HOW TO RUN MONORTM:
-------------------
Assuming you are in the main directory.

. Compilation:
  > cd src
  > make
  > rm *.o 
  > cd ..

. Running:
  > bin/monortm

. Visualization of the output:
  >cd idl
  >idl
  IDL> .run monortm.pro




HOW TO TAILOR MONORTM TO SPECIFIC NEEDS:
----------------------------------------
MONORTM id a driver program that calls the core module called the Monochromatic 
Optical Depth Model (MODM). 
The inputs to MODM could be modified inside monortm.f directly or through the input
file LBLRTM.IN (same type of format as LBLRTM's TAPE5).

. If MonoRTM is to use LBLRTM.IN, the control variable INP must be set to 1
  If MonoRTM is to use MONORTM_PROF.IN, INP must be set to 3.

. The version of the continuum to be used can be changed through the variable IVC

. Frequency: By default, MonoRTM runs for the microwave spectrum. It computes
  the brightness temperatures for the frequency range 0.1 -300 GHz (1000 spectral points)
  We can change that by modifying the wavenumbers to be processed either in LBLRTM.IN
  or in monortm.f itself.
