*      Note: Because a lot of effort is constantly being made
*      to improve MonoRTM (at the spectroscopic level, the 
*      line shape theory, the continuum, the radiative transfer
*      model, line coupling, etc,..), the user is therefore strongly 
*      advised to register to the MonoRTM mailing list. For this, 
*      simply send an email to sboukaba@aer.com or clough@aer.com.
*      You will be notified each time there is an update.

This is MONORTM directory. It contains several sub-directories described
briefly below:

CVS    -> For version control. Do not edit.
README -> This file.
bin    -> Contains the MonoRTM executable. Will be generated automatically.
	  In case LBLATM is ON, TAPE6 (LOG file) and TAPE7 will be generated also.
	  . MONORTM.LOG    : Log file for LBLATM
          . TAPE7          : profile info, in case INP=3 
in     -> Contains the input files 
          . spectral_lines.dat : contains the spectral lines informations.
          . MONORTM.IN          : input compatible with lblrtm (ex-TAPE5). INP=1
	  . ARM.IN             : List of ARM sondes. INP=2
	  . MONORTM_PROF.IN    : contains layer data, INP=3 (this is a copy of TAPE7
                                 which is generated by INP=2 or INP=1).
out -> output from MonoRTM is put in this directory: MONORTM.OUT. 
       IDL code to read this file and to make plots is available in idl sub-directory.
src -> contains all source files needed by MonoRTM as well as the build shell (maker).
doc -> detailed instructions manual about MonoRTM, in ascii format. 
idl -> visualization tool



HOW TO RUN MONORTM:
-------------------
Assuming you are in the main directory.

. Compilation:
  > cd src
  > make (this executes the makefile)
  > cd ..

. Running:
  > cd bin
  > monortm_v#
  > cd ..

. Visualization of the output:
  >cd idl
  >idl
  IDL> .run monortm.pro
  > cd ..


. Numerical check
  >cd out
  > diff MONORTM.OUT MONORTM.OUT_sample

HOW TO TAILOR MONORTM TO SPECIFIC NEEDS:
----------------------------------------
MONORTM id a driver program that calls the core module called the Monochromatic 
Optical Depth Model (MODM). 
The inputs to MODM could be modified inside monortm.f directly or through the input
file MONORTM.IN (same type of format as LBLRTM's TAPE5), see instructions for more details.
MonoRTM is a forward model. MonoRTM is designed to be very flexible. We can either use 
it as a black box and control everything from the MONORTM.IN input file, or one can modify 
the code itself and recompile it. In the latter, it is structured in such a way that the 
changes should always be done in "monortm.f" (the driver program). The other auxillary 
files (monortm_sub.f, modm.f, lblatm.f and declar.incl, continuumDATASTAT.dat) 
should normally not be touched, except in rare situations. In case there is an update 
in the continuum calculations a new file "continuumDATASTAT.dat" will be generated
and sent to the users (or made available on the WEB/ftp site). In the same way, if the 
spectroscopic database is to be updated, only the file "spectral_lines.dat" file should 
be replaced. The code would not need to be modified.
The core of MonoRTM is the computation of the optical depths. It is designed as a subroutine 
for flexibility and could be easily plugged in a different radiative transfer model if needed.
