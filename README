Version 4.1

This version of MonoRTM includes the MT_CKD 2.4 continuum (updated from
 MT_CKD 2.1). This continuum update includes significant changes 
to both the self and foreign broadened water vapor continuum in the 
microwave region.

Note that versions 4.0 onwards of MonoRTM represent a significant update 
to previous versions where the version number begins with 3 or below.
The code has been updated to allow the use of MonoRTM beyond the
microwave region (provided an appropriate spectral line file is used).
A number of changes were also made in order to make the input 
more consistent with that of LBLRTM.  Note that the INP option is no 
longer available.  The INP=1 option can be reproduced by setting IATM=1.
The INP=3 option may be reproduced by setting IATM=0. The INP=2 option 
is no longer available.  Users wishing to run multiple profiles may now 
do so by providing multiple profiles in the MONORTM.IN (for IATM=1) or
MONORTM_PROF.IN (for IATM=0) files.

This is MONORTM directory. It contains several sub-directories described
briefly below:

CVS    -> For version control. Do not edit.
README -> This file.
build  -> Contains makefiles for MonoRTM for different platforms
run    -> Contains files required to run MonoRTM.
	  .  run_monortm_example is a script to run some examples
	  .  spectral_lines.dat contains the spectral line information
	    - (Note that if you wish to run a calculation for a spectral range 
              outside the wavenumber range of the spectral line files supplied 
	      in the examples, you can create a line file using LNFL, which is
              publicly available on http://rtweb.aer.com.  The 
              spectral_lines.dat file is the same format as the LNFL TAPE7.)
	  -> subdirectory run/in contains sample input files
	     '_dn' denotes sample input files for downwelling radiance calculations
	     '_up' denotes sample input files for upwelling radiance calculations
		. MONORTM.IN         : input compatible with lblrtm (ex-TAPE5). IATM=1
                                       IDL code to generate profiles in TAPE5 format 
		                       from ARM netCDF radiosonde files is available 
                                       in the idl sub-directory  
	        . MONORTM_PROF.IN    : contains layer data, IATM=0 (this is a copy of TAPE7
                                       which is generated by a run where IATM=1
	  -> subdirectory run/out will hold the output from MonoRTM
		. MONORTM.OUT	     : IDL code to read this file and to make plots is 
				       available in idl sub-directory.
	        . MONORTM.LOG (if LBLATM is ON) - TAPE6 file
	        . TAPE7 (if LBLATM is ON)      
src -> contains all source files needed by MonoRTM.
doc -> detailed instructions manual about MonoRTM, in ascii format. 
idl -> visualization tool and tool for creating monortm input from ARM sonde files.

HOW TO RUN MONORTM:
-------------------
Assuming you are in the main directory.

. Compilation:
  > cd build
  > make -f (with your chosen makefile from the makefiles subdirectory)
  > cd ..

. Running (to generate example output):
  > cd run
  > run_monortm_examples
 (Note that you may have to modify the executable name in 
 "run_monortm_examples" to match the name of the executable that you 
  have created.)

. Visualization of the output (from the "run" directory):
  >idl
  IDL> .run ../idl/monortm.pro
  > cd ..


. Numerical check
  > cd run/out
  > diff MONORTM.OUT aer_MONORTM.OUT

HOW TO TAILOR MONORTM TO SPECIFIC NEEDS:
----------------------------------------
MONORTM is a driver program that calls the core module called the Monochromatic 
Optical Depth Model (MODM). 
The inputs to MODM could be modified inside monortm.f directly or through the input
file MONORTM.IN (same type of format as LBLRTM's TAPE5), see instructions for more details.
MonoRTM is a forward model. MonoRTM is designed to be very flexible. We can either use 
it as a black box and control everything from the MONORTM.IN input file, or one can modify 
the code itself and recompile it. In the latter, it is structured in such a way that the 
changes should always be done in "monortm.f" (the driver program). The other auxillary 
files (monortm_sub.f, modm.f, lblatm_monortm.f, lblrtm_sub.f, tips_2003.f, declar.incl and 
 isotope.dat) should normally not be touched, except in rare situations. In case
there is an update in the continuum calculations a new "contnm.f" module will be
generated and sent to the users (or made available on the WEB/ftp site). In the same
way, if the spectroscopic database is to be updated, only the file
"spectral_lines.dat" file should be replaced. The code would not need to be modified.
The core of MonoRTM is the computation of the optical depths. It is designed as a
subroutine for flexibility and could be easily plugged in a different radiative
transfer model if needed.
