Version 5.1 

Testing MonoRTM_v5.0 desmonstrated that the added capablity functionality to
handle species specific line broadening coefficients significacntly slows the
code down. An additional input parameter (IBRD)  was added to make using these
broadening coefficients optional.


Version 5.0 

The code was significantly restructured, new capabilities were added, and the spectroscopy was upgraded. 

* Restructuring (K. Cady-Pereira, G. Uymin, A. Lipton)

   - All routines except tips_2003.f are now f90.

   - The code's spectroscopic line input structure and atmospheric profiling
     code were made more consistent with LBLRTM. Line parameters are now read
     from a binary TAPE3 file (as in LBLRTM) produced with MonoLNFL, which is
     now included in the MonoRTM package.

   - The code to read in and store the spectroscopic data was removed from modm
     and is in a separate module: lnfl_mod.f90

   - The RT codes are also in a new module: RTMmono.f

   - Physical constants are all declared in one module, PhysConstants.f90, which
     also provides routines to access the values; geophysical parameters in
     another similar module, PlanetEarth.f90.

* Additional capabilities

   - The capability to utilize a speed-dependent Voigt line shape has been added
     using the approach of Boone et al. (2007; 2011) (M. Alvarado). 

   - The spectral region about line center in which the detailed Humlicek (1982)
     method is used to compute the line shape has been extended to provide
     greater accuracy (M. Alvarado, E. Mlawer, G. Villanueva).

   - The method to compute path lengths in the code's atmospheric module was
     changed to provide greater stability for cases with exceptionally high
     rates of change of refractive index with height (M. Alvarado, E. Mlawer, D.
     Turner, N. Miller)

   - A number of new input and output options, including optional netcdf output
     with spectral layer optical depths, have been added. (K. Cady-Pereira, D.
     Berthiaume)

   - Mixing ratio inputs are now allowed for IATM=0 (K. Cady-Pereira, J. Delamere)

   - The capability to utilize available line broadening coefficients (width,
     temperature dependence, pressure shift) that are specific to a given pair
     of species was added (K. Cady-Pereira, E. Mlawer, M. Alvarado).

   - A bug related to foreign broadening of oxygen transitions was fixed (E.
     Mlawer, M. Alvarado, K. Cady-Pereira).

   - A bug related to the use of the continuum in MonoRTM for near-IR cases was
     fixed (K. Cady-Pereira, M. Alvarado).

* Spectroscopy 

   - The default microwave line parameter files,
     spectral_lines.dat.0_55.v5.0_fast and spectral_lines.dat.0_55.v5.0_veryfast,
     now have a direct correspondence to the full AER linelist, whose current
     version is aer_v_3.3 (M. Alvarado, K. Cady-Pereira, E. Mlawer).

   - Numerous lines were added to the default microwave line files so that the
     calculational accuracy at any frequency between 0 and 899.4 GHz (0-30 cm-1)
     with respect to the full line list aer_v_3.3 is:

     # for spectral_lines.dat.0_55.v5.0_fast (corresponds to ISPD=0 in MonoRTM
       v4.2 and older): 0.1 K for upwelling, 0.2 K for downwelling  

     # for spectral_lines.dat.0_55.v5.0_veryfast (corresponds to ISPD=1 in MonoRTM
       v4.2 and older): 0.5 K for upwelling, 1.0 K for downwelling 
          (M. Alvarado, E. Mlawer, K. Cady-Pereira) 

     NOTE: Users who wish to run MonoRTM v5.0 in spectral regions other than the MW 
                should use the full AER line file (either aer_v_3.2 or aer_v_3.3), 
                keeping in mind that the full line file can take a long time to run.

   - Line parameters were taken from HITRAN 2012 with the exceptions noted below.

      1. 60 GHz O2 lines and 120 Ghz O2 line from Tretyakov et al. (2005), as
         implemented in MonoRTM v4.2.                                                                   

      2. 0 cm-1 "Debye line" for O2 same as in MonoRTM v4.2, all other O2 lines
         below 1.497951 cm-1 removed.                                                        

      3. The intensities for the H2O lines at 0.7417 cm-1 (22.233 GHz), 6.1145
         cm-1 (183.3 GHz), 10.84 cm-1 (325 GHz) and 12.68 cm-1 (380 GHz) are based on the
         work of S. A. Clough (1973) and are the same as in MonoRTM v4.2.

      4. The foreign widths of the 22 and 183 GHz water vapor lines were
         rederived based on HITRAN 2012 line parameters using the approach of Payne et
         al. (2009).  The temperature dependence parameters for these lines were adjusted
         from their HITRAN 2012 values to provide better agreement with calculations by
         Gamache (V. Payne, B. Gamache, E. Mlawer).

   - Broadening parameters were implemented for the following pairs of molecules:

      1. Oxygen transitions broadened by water vapor based on Drouin et al.
         (2013) (E. Mlawer, K. Cady-Pereira)

      2. Carbon dioxide transitions broadened by water vapor based on 
         Sung (2009) (K. Cady-Pereira).

      3. Water vapor transitions broadened by carbon dioxide based on
         calculations by R. Gamache of U. Mass. Lowell (K. Cady-Pereira).

      4. Carbon dioxide transitions broadened by carbon dioxide based on
         calculations by R. Gamache of U. Mass. Lowell (K. Cady-Pereira).

   - The continuum was updated to MT_CKD_2.5.  

   - Speed dependent parameters were implemented for CO2 transitions in the
     bands 68<-1 and 71<-1 (i.e., 30012<-00001 and 30013<-00001) following Devi
         et al. (2007a,b) (M. Alvarado).

****************************************************************
Version 4.3

This version of MonoRTM includes the MT_CKD 2.5.2 continuum (updated from
 MT_CKD 2.4). This continuum update includes a bug fix to the N2 continuum.

Note that versions 4.0 onwards of MonoRTM represent a significant update  
to previous versions where the version number begins with 3 or below.
The code has been updated to allow the use of MonoRTM beyond the
microwave region (provided an appropriate spectral line file is used).
A number of changes were also made in order to make the input 
more consistent with that of LBLRTM.  Note that the INP option is no 
longer available.  The INP=1 option can be reproduced by setting IATM=1. 
The INP=3 option may be reproduced by setting IATM=0. The INP=2 option  
is no longer available.  Users wishing to run multiple profiles may now 
do so by providing multiple profiles in the MONORTM.IN (for IATM=1) or
MONORTM_PROF.IN (for IATM=0) files.

****************************************************************
MONORTM_v4.2

An error related to the print-out of total optical depths in the
MONORTM.OUT file was corrected.

****************************************************************

MONORTM_v4.1

 Code is now using MT_CKD_2.4 continuum, which includes significant updates to
the self- and foreign-broadened water vapor continuum in the range 0 to 600
cm-1 (0 to 18 THz), based on new analyses of ARM measurements in the microwave
and far-IR regions. (Payne et al., 2011; Delamere et al., 2010).  

An error related to calculations for multiple profiles was corrected.  

Code has been modified to pass optical depth arrays between subroutines as
arguments in order to improve modularity of the Monochromatic Optical Depth
Model (MODM) module. In addition, the IOD option may now be used as a flag to
output layer optical depths to ascii files.

****************************************************************

MONORTM_v4.0

Code has been updated to allow monochromatic calculations at frequencies
beyond the microwave region. These updates include the implementation of CO2
line coupling and the option to include cross-section molecules.

Format of output files has been modified to accommodate this change.

Calculation of the total internal partition sum has been updated to be
consistent with the calculation in LBLRTM.

MonoRTM now uses MT_CKD_2.1 continuum (previously was using CDK_2.4).

An error in the nitrogen continuum has been corrected.

The INP option has been replaced by the use of IATM=1 or IATM=0 (consistent
with LBLRTM). A stand-alone IDL program is provided to convert ARM netCDF
profiles into MONORTM input format.

****************************************************************

MONORTM_v3.3

Directory structure has been changed to make it more consistent with LBLRTM

The 22GHz and the 183GHz water vapor lines have been updated (Payne et al, 2008)

increase accuracy at higher frequencies and lower water vapor amounts

****************************************************************

MONORTM_v2.20

Code has been restructured and made more robust

New makefiles allow for the creation of single and double precision code on
SGIs and on MacOSX

currently used by LBLRTM

Several minor coding inconsistencies, which led to compilation errors under
some compilers, have been eliminated

****************************************************************

MONORTM_v2.11

O2 line coupling parameters have been modified to yield significantly better
agreement with MWRP measurements in the 50-60 GHz range

Code output contains more detailed information on the current version of the
software and the spectral lines file
