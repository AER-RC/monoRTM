*                        USER INSTRUCTIONS FOR MONORTM
* 
*                                December 2013
*
*       NOTE: IMPORTANT CHANGE IN MONORTM_v5.0 !!!!!!!!!!
*       MONORTM now reads in spectroscopic information from a binary file called TAPE3.
*       This file must be created by running the MONOlnfl code which is part of the
*       release package. The selection of a reduced set of parameters for the microwave
*       (the ISPD=1) option is now done by selecting the appropriate input file for MonoLNFL. 
*       The ISPD parameter is no longer used by MONORTM code.
*
*	Note: All flags or records with a * sign are either used  
*	differently (wrt LBLRTM) or are specific to MONORTM.
*
*       Note: Currently, inputs of cloud amount can be input
*	only from MONORTM_PROF.IN with IATM=0 (the cloud is read along 
*       with the other layer information).

 RECORD 1.1
--------------

 
      CXID:  80 characters of user identification  (80A1)
 
            CXID(1) is the flag which determines program initialization and termination.  
	            The actual input data stream for MONORTM commences with the record 
                    containing a '$' in CXID(1).  Any records that are read prior to a 
                    record containing a '$' in CXID(1) are ignored.  Since MONORTM 
                    automatically recycles and reads Record 1.1 at the end of each run 
                    (this allows the stacking of multiple runs), each subsequent run 
                    of MONORTM must also have a '$' in CXID(1) on Record 1.1.  In order
                    to effect a normal termination of MONORTM, CXID(1) must be set to '%', 
                    on the final record of the input file.  Thus a standard MONORTM input 
                    file would begin with a '$' and end with a '%'. Records on the input 
                    file following the record with CXID(1) = '%' are ignored by MONORTM.
 
 		    NOTE: If IATM=0 only records 1.1 through 1.4 are needed in MONORTM.IN;
                    a separate MONORTM_PROF.IN file is required (see records 2.1.1 through 2.1.3),
                    which contains the profile layer information (similar to TAPE7 in LBLRTM).

 RECORD 1.3

	       This is used to compute simulations for a set of equally-spaced wavenumbers.  
	       If we want to perform the simulations for a number of non-equally-spaced  
	       wavenumbers, we can set V1 or V2 (or both ) to any negative value. MONORTM 
	       will then expect record 1.3.1 and record 1.3.2
 
             V1,     V2,           DVSET,        NMOL_SCAL

                  V1 -->   beginning wavenumber value for the calculation
			   If negative, see record 1.3.1
                  V2 -->   ending wavenumber value for the calculation
			   If negative, see record 1.3.1
              *DVSET -->   Stepsize of the monochromatic calculation by MONORTM.
			   IF DVSET=0 and V1=V2, then the caclulation will be performed
		           for V1=V2 only. 
           NMOL_SCAL  -->  Enables the scaling of the atmospheric profile for selected species
                           NMOL_SCAL is the highest molecule number for which scaling will be applied
                           See Record(s) 1.3.a/1.3.b.n
			   Note that this scaling option is applied before call to LBLATM and therefore
			   only works for IATM=1.
